# Equalizer_V001
 
This project is an equalizer VST plugin.

It features 3 band pass filters with Q and frequency and gain controls.

And a high pass and low pass filters with cutoff frequency and gain controls.

My contribution to the project is the written in the files:

Equalizer_V001/MyEffect/src/EffectExtra.h

Equalizer_V001/MyEffect/src/EffectPlugin.ccp

Equalizer_V001/MyEffect/src/EffectPlugin.h

These files contain the code for the UI controls and filtering of the audio signal.
